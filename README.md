# Predicting Stars, Galaxies, and Quasars using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for predicting astronomical objects (stars, galaxies, and quasars) using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on classifying celestial objects based on their observed characteristics and features.

## Project Overview

Identifying and classifying astronomical objects such as stars, galaxies, and quasars is fundamental to understanding the universe's structure and evolution. This project employs machine learning algorithms to classify celestial objects using observational data collected from telescopes and space missions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for cleaning and preparing astronomical data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting relevant features from observational data (e.g., photometric and spectroscopic data).
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of classification algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics and methods for evaluating the performance of classification models.
- **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing astronomical data and model predictions.
